\title{Resonant inductive coupling}
\author{Isawan Millican}
\maketitle

Prior to the development of the electrical grid,
there were great efforts to transmit power wirelessly by inductive coupling.
Early efforts were limited by inefficiency in transmission over larger distances.
Work carried out by Nikola Tesla in the early 20\textsuperscript{th} century
demonstrated that improved efficiency can be achieved by resonant inductive coupling.
In this article, a review of the principles of induction is given.
An explaination of how resonance can be applied to improve efficiency of the phenomena.
We then briefly consider applications of resonant inductive

\section{A Review of Electromagnetic Induction}

Electromagnetic induction was first discovered independently by
Michael Faraday in 1831 and Joseph Henry in 1832.\cite{faradaypublishedfirst}
A current carrying primary coil of wire generates a magnetic field.
The magnetic field then induces a current on a secondary coil,
proportional to the magnetic flux.
However, the produced magnetic field diverges very quickly outside the coil.
This meant that induction apparatus were highly inefficient unless the coils
were directly adjacent.

\section{Improving efficiency to resonance}

The inefficiency of the initial system was overcome by Tesla in 1914 with the
invention of the Tesla coil\cite{tesla}.
