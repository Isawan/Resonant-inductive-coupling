\title{Resonant inductive coupling}
\author{Isawan Millican}
\maketitle

Prior to the development of the electric grid,
there were great efforts to transmit power wirelessly by inductive coupling.
Early efforts were limited by inefficiency in transmission over larger distances.
Work carried out by Nikola Tesla in the early 20\textsuperscript{th} century
demonstrated that improved efficiency can be achieved by resonant inductive coupling.
More recently, research on efficient transmission at larger distances is being studied.
In this article we will review the principles of resonant inductive coupling,
the successes of modern research and some of the applications in the technique.
